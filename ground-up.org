make objects of fixed size
- pointers to variable-size data
-> easy navigation between indices

* addressing modes
- immediate: hard-coded val
- direct: mem address
- indexed: base and offset index
-- index multiplier: data size
- indirect: pointer (stored in mem)
- base pointer: initial offset (skip header info)


as: *assemble* source (.s) into obj (.o) file
- object code: non-runable, contains relocation info (symbols, etc)
ld: *link* object into executable
- add info req'd by kernel to run

hexdump: view obj code
od -c: view obj code
